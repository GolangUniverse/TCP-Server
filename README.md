# TCP-Server

## This is a simple description of how to build a custom TCP Server using Golang

The Transmission Control Protocol (**TCP**) is a transport protocol 
that is used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets. 
TCP includes mechanisms to solve many of the problems that arise from packet-based messaging,
such as lost packets, out of order packets, duplicate packets, and corrupted packets.

 - Read from incoming connections
 - Write from incoming connections
